Unable to find gconftool-2.  The mendeley:// link handler may not be installed correctly.
Mendeley Desktop will run normally. Some Web interactions might not work as expected (e.g. CSL Editor Save).
Install the package gconf2 to fix it. E.g. 'sudo apt-get install gconf2' or 'sudo yum install gconf2'.
